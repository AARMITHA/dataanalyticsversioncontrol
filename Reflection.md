# Reflection: Version Control in My Data Analytics Project

Version control using Git and GitHub helped me manage my data analytics workflow effectively.
Throughout this project, I maintained separate scripts for preprocessing and analysis while keeping a well-documented Jupyter notebook.

Each commit represented a meaningful stage of progress, making it easy to track updates, review earlier code, and ensure reproducibility.
Pushing my work to GitHub provided a backup in the cloud and made collaboration simple.
This hands-on experience improved my understanding of version control and emphasized how important it is for data-driven, collaborative projects.
